# Hexona OS - Complete Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Transform the automation proposal process from a chaotic, opaque system with 5% success rate into a transparent, efficient pipeline that converts 25%+ of inquiries into delivered projects, while reducing proposal creation time by 80%.

### 1.2 Core Problem
The current workflow fragments across WhatsApp, Discord, ClickUp, and Google Docs, creating a "fog of war" where proposals disappear after being sent. With 32 proposals stuck in "SENT" status and no visibility into partner activities, the business cannot scale beyond 6 deliveries from 120+ proposals.

### 1.3 Strategic Solution
A unified platform that enforces quality at the point of creation through structured triage, provides complete visibility across the proposal lifecycle, and actively manages the post-proposal engagement through automated nudges and partner self-service.

## 2. Product Architecture & Philosophy

- Templates and guidance reduce variation
- AI-powered quality scoring before sending

**Pull System Over Push Chaos**
- Work is pulled when ready, not pushed randomly
- WIP limits prevent overload
- Clear capacity visualization

**Engagement Over Abandonment**
- Automated nudges prevent proposals from dying in silence
- Partner portal maintains momentum
- Structured feedback loops capture why deals fail
